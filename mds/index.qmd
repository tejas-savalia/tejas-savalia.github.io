Hello!
I am Tejas. I'm a PhD Candidate in Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I work on statistical learning and memory. I use computational models and behavioral experiments to understand how we extract and store patterns around us. I get excited by inferential statistics and simulations. In my free time, I like to read and play boardgames.
