    "text": "Hello! I’m a Postdoc at Emory University. I work in the LumenLab on the neural and computational mechanisms underling emotion and motivation and their effect on statistical learning and memory. I use neuroimaging and behavioral experiments with computational modeling to understand how we extract and store patterns around us. I get excited by inferential statistics and simulations. In my free time, I like to read and play boardgames.\nSee my scholar profile for a complete list of publications.\nNews:\n\nSep 2023: Started working as a postdoc at the LumenLab.\nAug 2023: Completed my dissertation at UMass.\nPaper accepted at Journal of Affective Disorders\nPaper accepted at JEP:HPP"
